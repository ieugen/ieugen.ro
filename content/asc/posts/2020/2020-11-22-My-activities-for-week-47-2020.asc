== Write Gnome extensions with ClojureScript

This week besides some client work I contributed to https://github.com/titonbarua/shadow-cljs-gjs-target/[shadow-cljs-gjs-target].
`shadow-cljs-gjs-target` is a plugin for https://shadow-cljs.org/[Shadow CLJS] that allows people to build Gnome applications in ClojureScript via https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs/[GJS Gnome JavaScript Bindings].

This started from my desire to build Gnome Extensions so I can improve my workflow.
I use Gnome on my Debian system and I would like to improve how I manage my time.
I thought about using an extension to help me with my time tracking app - hledger - which is a plain text tool.

I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMyR5lJf7dU&list=PLr3kuDAFECjZhW-p56BoVB7SubdUHBVQT[How to create GNOME Extension] video series on YouTube and I thought - can I do this with Clojure(Script)?

As I said, I wanted to see if I can build Gnome extensions in ClojureScript.
Since Gnome extensions are written in JavaScript and use Gjs I thought that a good place to start is shadow-cljs-gjs-target.

I got feedback from the plugin author https://github.com/titonbarua[@titonbarua] and also ShadowCLJS author Thomas Heller.
I was able to draft a working example and the https://github.com/titonbarua/shadow-cljs-gjs-target/pull/2[PR to build Gnome Extensions with ClojureScript] was merged.

When I have some time I would like to explore making some useful Gnome extensions.
I will probably start with porting the https://gitlab.com/justperfection.channel/how-to-create-a-gnome-shell-extension/[How to create a GNOME extension code] from JavaScript to Clojure.
