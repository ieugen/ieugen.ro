== Kubernetes and cloud

This week I had some client work around Kubernetes.
I had to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with SSO with Dex.
I configured Dex to delegate authentication via LDAP to a FreeIPA installation.

I encountered some problems during the process and submitted relevant issues and when possible a PR with documentation.

I discovered why groups where not working with Dex and LDAP and subbmitted a https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/937[PR to improve documentaiton for for OpenID Connect scope] param of oauth2_proxy.

== Helm Controller

I also submitted an improvment suggestion for https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/issues/80[k3s helm controller to allow debug].
This was related to the current not-so-good way of how https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-helm/pull/22[Helm Controller handles re-installs and un-ininstalls].
I've also contributted a https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/issues/65[PR for k3s helm controller docs] - after some feedback from the Slack channel.

During a Kubernetes outage for another client I discovered that the error message the kubelet shows is not very relevant and added my feedback to https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/2427[open issue about missing kubernetes certificates].
