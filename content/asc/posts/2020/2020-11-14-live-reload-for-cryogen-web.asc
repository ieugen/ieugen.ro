== Why?

Some things work better when you have instant feedback.
Developing your Cryogen theme is among them.
To get (near) instant feedback when developing your theme or writing content you can use link:https://github.com/livereload/livereload-extensions[Live Reload, window=_blank].

Using this workflow will allo you to work on your theme, save the file and have the browser refresh with your changes.

This flow dowes not work when you are writing content due to some issues.

This guide is inspired by link:https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/issues/118[Cryogen #118, window=_blank].

== How it works

To have the browser refresh after you save your files we need a couple of things:

* a way to monitor the filesystem for changes - Live Reload server component
* a way to communicate the change to the browser to trigger a reload - Live Reload browser extension

The browser communicates with the server via Web Sockets.

Now, for the live-reload server component we have two options:

* Add some code into our app to open a live reload port - like link:https://github.com/bhurlow/clj-livereload[clj-livereload,window=_blank]
* Use a stand alone live reload server like link:https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload[Guard live reload,window=_blank]
* Use an IDE plugin/extension that implements the LiveReload server component

I haven't tried the stand alone approache so I'm going to explain how to use clj-livereload.

== Implement Live-Reload

To implement live reload usin `clj-livereload` we need to the following:

* Add `clj-livereload` to our cryogen website dependencies in `project.clj`
* Add some code in the compilation step to start a live-reload server and monitor
* Install the Live Reload extension in your browser

NOTE: This guide assumes you are working on a Cryogen Web website started by following the link:http://cryogenweb.org/docs/getting-started.html[Quickstart,window=_blank] using `lein`.
You will need to adapt it if you are using something else.

=== Install LiveReload server component with clj-livereload

Firs we need to add the clj-livereload dependency in our project:
Open `project.clj`, find `:dependencies` key and add `[clj-livereload "0.2.0"]`.
Please use a more recent version if you need to.

You should have something like this:

.project.clj
[source,clojure]
--
(defproject cryogen "0.1.0"
            ;; REDACTED for brevity
            :dependencies [;; REDACTED for brevity
                           [clj-livereload "0.2.0"]
                           ]
)
--

Once we have the dependency we need to start the live reload server when we run `lein ring server` to compile our website.

To do that open `src/cryogen/server.clj` and start live-reload during ring server initialization like so:

[source,clojure]
--
(ns cryogen.server
  (:require
   ;; REDACTED FOR BREVITY
   [clj-livereload.server :as live-reload]
   ))

(defn init []
  (load-plugins)
  (compile-assets-timed)
  (let [ignored-files (-> (resolve-config) :ignored-files)
        ;; We will monitor public-dest dir. Cryogen will output files there.
        public-dest (-> (resolve-config) :public-dest)]
    (start-watcher! "content" ignored-files compile-assets-timed)
    (start-watcher! "themes" ignored-files compile-assets-timed)
    ;; Add these two lines to
    (println (str "Start Live Reload " public-dest))
    (live-reload/start! {:paths [public-dest]
                         :debug? true}))
  )
--

Once this is done you should test if it works.
Run `lein ring server` and watch the output.
You should see something like this at the end of the cryogen compilation:

[source,bash]
--
## REDACTED FOR BREVITY ##
"Elapsed time: 3926.635827 msecs"
Start Live Reload public
Starting LiveReload server
Watching directories...
2020-11-14 23:35:32.238:INFO:oejs.Server:main: jetty-9.2.21.v20170120
--


== Install the browser extension

I have installed this Firefox extension: https://github.com/twolfson/livereload-extensions via
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livereload-web-extension/ .
For Chrome you can find a similar one https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei

== Known issues

For some reason thisa fails sometimes:
* The page reloads with a 'Page not found'.
Just refresh.
This is caused by how cryogen currently works and should be fixed once https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/pull/220[ Support for incremental page compilation] is merged.
