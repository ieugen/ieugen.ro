== Better support for Romanian text in tools

This is a project I started a long time ago (~ 2010 ?!) and then I stopped working on it.
Time to work on it again.

The idea is to build a corpus of texts that is free to use so we can process and build free dictionaries for spell-checking, predictive text and other tooling around this.
