== Hobby / other

In ~2016 I decided that every year I will take a class to learn something new.
The class/course should be about something I like or find interesting, in fields other than my work.

So far:

* I've learned double entry accounting and I keep my personal finances using {HLedger}, a tool for {plaintextaccounting}.
* I have a {SailorPermit} Class D, C and S and I go sailing from time to time.
* Took dance classes (ongoing): Salsa, Bachata and Kizomba - I love to move and love the festivals.
* I'm a licensed massage therapist
* Took cooking classes in Bucharest and Hoi-An / Vietnam
