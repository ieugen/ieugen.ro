I applied and was selected to participate in the {Gsoc2011} program.
{ApacheJames} is an enterprise email server written in Java. It is a component based, high performance enterprise email server.
During the program I implemented an mailbox storage solution on top of {HBase}.
I also contributed a fast iterator-like interface over email messages stored in an mbox file. This contribution is part of {ApacheJamesMime4j}.

After the project I was proposed and accepted to become an {ApacheCommitter} and later, a member of the project management committee.
