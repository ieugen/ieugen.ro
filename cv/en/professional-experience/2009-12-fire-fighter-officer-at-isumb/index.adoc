My first long full-time job was as a Fire Fighter.
My responsibility was to command a fire-fighting unit in training and rescue operations.
I participated in about 100 rescue operations and missions with Detasamentul Special de Salvatori.

I also got a small sponsorship in IT equipment. I wanted to do a digital migration and use electronic tools and documents.
