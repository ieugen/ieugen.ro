This is my second company. I use this company to work on various projects.

== API integration {Manychat} and {Mobilpay}
icon:calendar[] May 2020, {Robomarketing}

The client wanted to enable card payment via {Messenger} marketing robots. I've used {PHP} with {Laravel} and {Docker} to build an {API} integration on top of the clients existing {Wordpress} hosting solution.

== Gr8pi SaaS - People assessment platform

My third start-up experience. I had many hats: developer, team manager, solution architect, managed operations, investor.

**Context**

The {GreatPeopleInside} company sells assessments used in {HR} processes. I've helped to build the {gr8pi} platform, a {SaaS} internet platform that delivers the assessments internationally. When I left we had clients on all major continents and delivered more than 500.000 questionnaires in more than 20 languages.

I started as a developer and bootstrapped the project by writing the first lines of ({Java}) code. As the team formed, I took on team management responsibilities. When we went live, I also took on a {DevOps} hat. I was in contact with the client and provided technical solutions and designed the project architecture. I worked with a remote team from Vietnam and had to overcome language and timezone challenges.

It was interesting, it was fun, it was stressful. I've done a lot, I've learned a lot and I have grown a lot from this experience.

**Infrastructure**

We deployed on {Hetzner} and {Aws}. I pushed for {Docker} adoption and then {Kubernetes}. I automated infrastructure deployment via {terraform}, {ansible} and {kubespray}.
I pushed for centralized {IdentityManagement} to reduce operational overhead. We started with {LDAP} and then we implemented web {SSO} via {Azure} AD and {Keycloak}.

To deliver the products to all the 20+ languages, the company needed an affordable translation solution. I deployed {Weblate} and then integrated with {Office365} via {Azure} AD for easy management.

We had separate {Kubernetes} clusters and environments for production and staging/development.
I've implemented {SSO} with {OpenIdConnect} for development infrastructure: {Jenkins}, {Nexus}, {Kubernetes}, etc.

I implemented a tool using {Clojure} to automate translation updates from {Weblate} for our production systems.

**Development**

{Gr8pi} was deployed using a micro-service architecture.
We held daily {Scrum} meetings and worked in development sprints.
We used {Bitbucket} for code hosting and {Jira} for issue tracking.

We used {Gradle} as a build system. We packaged applications as {Docker} images and pushed them to {Nexus}. For staging environment I implemented automated deployment on every {Jenkins} build.
